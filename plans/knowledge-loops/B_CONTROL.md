## Stop (required)

**Command:**

```text
python scripts/check_knowledge_tree.py --pack control
```


---

## Objective

Every COVERAGE unit under control has notes.md (≥1500 words, required headings), questions.md (≥5 original worked Qs with Given/Find/Solution/Answer), sources.md. link FBS; do not copy.

## Non-goals

- Do not write other packs
- Do not commit commercial book or GATE paper text
- Do not copy NC-licensed OER
- Do not wire RAG

---

## Contract

**Input:**

```json
{}
```

**Maker output:** `{ "files_touched": [], "notes": "" }`

**Checker output:** `{ "pass": false, "command": "", "exit_code": 1, "findings": [] }`

---

## Escalate

After `max_rounds` failures, or if the checker cannot run the stop: **stop the loop**, set status `escalated`, wait for the human. Do not start the next dependent node.

## Do not

- Commit, push, or open a PR
- Write outside **Write paths**
- Checker: write product files, or be the same Task as the maker
- Expand into another graph
- Load sibling loop plans
- Touch `src/`, `ui/`, `workflows/`, `eval/gold/`, `docs/PID.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/PRODUCT.md`
- Use Cursor `/loop` timers

## Return to graph

Maker: files touched, notes. Checker: pass, command, exit code, findings.
Lead updates `B_CONTROL.state.json`.
